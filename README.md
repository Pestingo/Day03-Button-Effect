🛠️ How It Works
Button Animation: The button uses @keyframes to animate four border elements (span tags), which create the effect of the border moving around the button.
Responsive Centering: The button is centered on the page using transform: translate(-50%, -50%);.
Gradient Borders: The borders of the button are animated with linear gradients to give a modern and dynamic look.
